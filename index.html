             <p>Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often implement ideas from less tech-savvy colleagues who lack the know-how to turn their vision into an actual, functional website.Job opportunities for web developers are expected to expand by about 13% or the decade ending in 2028, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is more than twice the 5% rate projected for all occupations. Growth is attributed to the increasing popularity of e-commerce and mobile applications for multiple tasks. Web developers work for a variety of employers in the government, nonprofit, and corporate sectors. However, many also work independently on a contract basis or for web development firms. The majority of the work is on a computer, so it’s important to be comfortable sitting at a desk for long stretches of time. Not all work is in front of the computer, however. Web developers often have to consult with employers or clients about the needs of the site and to review progress.</p>  <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/web-developer-job-description-salary-and-skills-2061841">more on </a>

             <p>A broadcast presenter is the face or voice of programmes broadcast via television, radio and the internet. You'll work on a variety of platforms including national, regional, satellite and cable television, local and national radio and online. Your role is to entertain and inform an audience by presenting information or entertainment in an accessible and attractive way. You'll introduce, host (or co-host) a programme, create links between items, introduce and interview guests and interact with the audience. The exact nature of the job may vary according to a programme's subject matter, for example if it covers news, weather, sport, music or lifestyle. You'll work much longer than the actual broadcast hours and work is rarely, if ever, 9am to 5pm. Pre-show preparation, such as meetings with the producer, researching, writing scripts, rehearsing and post-show review, which includes discussing the broadcast with the producer and beginning advance planning for the next show, all add to the working day. Hours may be long and unsocial, involving early mornings, evenings or weekends, although this depends on the timing of the programme and whether it's live or pre-recorded. Working conditions vary, depending on the broadcast medium and type of programme. For example, conditions for a presenter on a small local radio station with a show in the middle of the night will be vastly different from those for a high-profile celebrity with a prime-time television show. Most presenters, particularly those on national radio and television, employ an agent to negotiate working terms and conditions on their behalf. Most work is based in a radio or television studio, but may also include outside broadcasts, which can involve working in all conditions. Much of the national broadcast industry is centred in London or MediaCityUK in Salford. Other studios exist in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Birmingham. Local or regional studios are found throughout much of the UK. You'll have a public image to maintain and, as a result, must be prepared for some loss of privacy. Travel during the working day varies according to the type of programme. </p>  <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/web-developer-job-description-salary-and-skills-2061841">more on </a>
